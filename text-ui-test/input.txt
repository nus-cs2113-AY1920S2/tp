Resurrection Stone
The Resurrection Stone is one of the fabled Deathly Hallows.
In "The Tale of the Three Brothers", it was the second Hallow created, supposedly by Death himself
It was bestowed upon Cadmus Peverell after he requested, as his bounty, something with the power to recall loved ones from Death
According to legend, whoever reunited it with the other two Hallows (the Elder Wand and the Cloak of Invisibility) would become the Master of Death
