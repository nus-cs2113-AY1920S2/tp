## 1. Setting Up

You can find the set-up instructions [here](https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2113-T14-2/tp/blob/master/README.md).

## 2. Design 

The design of the project from the point of view of the user can be described as follows:

![Image of Design](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY1920S2-CS2113-T14-2/tp/master/docs/images/design.png)

The above figure demonstrates that once a user inputs a command through the **UI** component, the user response is sent to the **Commands** component for processing. Depending on the user response, the commands component can either i) affect existing lists of jobs, news or articles in the **Lists** component or ii) give user access to new articles through the **API** component or iii) load pre-existing information pieces (articles, jobs) inputted into the program through the **Creator** component. More commands can be called on information pieces loaded through the **API** component or the **Creator** component using the **Commands** component. When the program terminates, the lists of articles, jobs and notes are stored through the **Storage** component.

## 3. Implementation

This section will describe the design and implementation of a notable feature in the project.

Note: You will need to create an `article`, `job` or `note` for the feature. It can be done through the following commands.

     1. create article
     2. create job
     3. create note
                        
For more information about the `create` feature, please refer to the user guide [here](https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2113-T14-2/tp/blob/master/docs/UserGuide.md#create-command).

### `create` feature

**Current Implementation:**

The `InformationCreator` is a standalone class inside the `commands` package. The `create` feature helps the user create information objects that can be instances of `article`, `note` and `job` classes and automatically add them an ArrayList of object types Article, Job, or Note, respectively. 

Given below is an example usage and how the `CreateCommand` mechanism behaves at each step:

* Step 1:
The user launches the application and it loads the `SavedNoteList`, `SavedArticleList` and `SavedJobList` from the storage using the corresponding JSON files("articleList.json", "jobList.json" and "noteList.json"). If even one of these JSON files do not exist in the memory, the application creates entirely new JSON files with empty initial ArrayLists to store articles, jobs and notes. 

* Step 2:
The user enters the command, `create article`, for instance, into the command line. The`TechToday#executeProgram()` method from the ProgramExecutor class parses the command provided and takes the first word of the command. Since the first word is `create`, it calls a static  `InformationCreator#execute(userResponse)` method, where `userResponse` is the original command provided by the user.

* Step 3:
The  `InformationCreator#execute(userResponse)` method again parses the user command to check what kind of information object the user is seeking to create. The three possibilities are `article`, `job` and `note`. The following daigram illustrates what steps are taken for different user responses.


![Image of SwitchCase](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AY1920S2-CS2113-T14-2/tp/master/docs/images/switchCase.png)


* Step 4:
As seen from the above diagram, since the user response was `create article`, the static method, `ManualArticleCreator#execute()`, is called.

* Step 5:
The `ManualArticleCreator#execute()` method asks the user for information including **title**, **url**, **category**, and **extract** of the article by calling `Ui#getArticleTitle()`, `Ui#getArticleUrl()`, `Ui#getArticleCategory()` and `Ui#getArticleExtract()` methods respectively. The `ManualArticleCreator#execute()` fetches the current time and creates a timestamp of that time. The timestamp is assigned to a String variable called **epochSecond**. The five afformentioned variables(in bold) are used to create an `article` object, which is then added to the `SavedArticleList` eventually.


*The following sequence diagram summarizes how `create` command works:*

## 3. Product Scope

### Value Proposition

As _lifelong learners of technology brekthroughs, computer science and closely related disciplines_, we have access to so many news portals, job portals and we create notes ourselves. Given the sheer volume of information we have, it almost becomes hard for one to manage all that information. TechToday Information Tracker (TTIT) is for who want to organise information about technology. In particular, it helps a user **view** new articles/jobs from HackerNews (or pre-loaded articles in the event of no internet), **save** viewed articles/jobs and **create** information describing not only articles/jobs from other sources but also notes. All in all, TTIT's value stems from being an application that helps you manage your information about technology so that you do not have to feel drowned by the sheer volume of publicly available information about technology.

Note that TTIT utilizes [Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API) to give the user the option to view new news articles and jobs and also has a feature to save them. 


### Target user profile

TechToday Information Tracker (TTIT) is targeted at _lifelong learners of technology brekthroughs, computer science and closely related disciplines__ who wish to organise the information that they consume.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

1. This application should be able to work on Linux, Windows, and OS machines as long the user has installed Java 11. 

2. Any user with knowledge of English language and basic typing skills should be able to use this application without any issues. If user is unable to understand commands, please see User Guide for more clarification. 

3. User interface should be seen through the terminal and, depending on command user is using, depict changes the user is making within the application. 

4. The data the user manipulated using the application should be saved once they type `exit` which saves and exits the application. This data is restored when the user uses the application again. 

5. If one wishes to use application from different computer with saved data, they just must transfer their saves JSON files to the new folder where the application will be run. 

6. The application should not crash at any moment. If there is an error within application, error message will appear. 

7. If the application is unable to connect to the internet to retrieve data for `view` feature, the application will still produce data that has been previously saved. 

## 6. Testing

JUnit tests were created for this application to ensure that our code is free of bugs, runs correclty, and outputs the intended data. 

### 6.1 IntelliJ JUnit Tests

1. To run all tests, right click on `src/test/java` and click Run "Tests in tp". 

2. To run using Gradle, open terminal and type `gradlew clean test`

## 7. Instructions for Manual Testing

Follow the following steps to manually test the product:

###  7.1 Setup and Initial Storage Testing

1. Download the latest release [here](ljsnc) and store it in an empty folder. 

2. Open the terminal and go to the folder where the file is stored and type `java -jar tp.jar` to initialize the program. 

3. Once the program starts, you should get a welcome message with possible commands.


4. **Note** Ensure that it outputs `All the required files do not exist. We will create completely new files to save your data.` 

5. Type `list article` and ensure the initial list is empty. You should get the following output: 

            __________________________________________________________________________________________


            _                                   Article List                                   _


            _                      There is nothing in the list currently.                     _
            __________________________________________________________________________________________
           

6. You should get a similar output for `list note` and `list job`: 


7. Type `exit` to exit the program. 


9. Rerun by typing `java -jar tp.jar` to start the program again.

**Note** The message `Loading "articleList.json", "jobList.json" and "notelist.json"...` and `Done loading files, enter your command now:` should appear instead of previous message of missing data. This is to ensure these JSON files were created the first time you run the program. 

### 7.2 Load Storage Testing 

1. Go to the sampleData folder [here](https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2113-T14-2/tp/tree/master/docs/sampleData) and copy paste the contents of 'articleList.json', 'noteList.json', 'jobList.json' using your text editor into files called 'articleList.json', 'noteList.json', 'jobList.json' respectively and store it in the same folder where you stored the original jar file. If you have already run the program and existing JSON data files exist, replace them with the ones from the sampleData folder. 

2. Open the terminal and go afformentioned folder and type `java -jar tp.jar`.

3. This should load all the data in the folders. Type the following commands:

  * `list article`
        
    You will get the following output:

            __________________________________________________________________________________________
