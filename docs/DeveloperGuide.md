## 1. Design & Implementation

<a name="search-stock"></a>

### 1.1 Search stock feature
#### 1.1.1 Proposed implementation

In the restaurant daily report, users can search against the stock category by supplying a keyword.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the search mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. An empty `stock` will be initialized.

Step 2. The user executes `add stock; i/tomato; q/10; p/0.40;` command to add a tomato ingredient into the `stock`. Further, the user may add more ingredients into the current `stock`. Suppose the user executes `add stock; i/potato; q/5; p/0.40;` and `add stock; i/rice; q/3; p/0.40;` as well.

Step 3. The user can now search against the current `stock` to see if an ingredient is stored in the `stock`. The user now executes `search stock; k/tomato;`, which will display the following result in the image. 

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59989652/78976850-a0deb380-7b49-11ea-9235-a4659d611f7b.png">
</p>

Step 4. If the ingredient that the user is searching for does not exist within the stock, a different message will be displayed as shown in the following image.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59989652/78976997-ee5b2080-7b49-11ea-8ff1-e62e59e508f9.png">
</p>

The following sequence diagram shows how the search operation works:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59989652/78683492-efaa0480-7921-11ea-82c4-e2b4abb9da92.png">
</p>


The sequence diagram can be interpreted as such:
1. `CommandParser` calls its own `CommandParser#parseCommand(...)`. 
2. Assuming the user input the search stock command correctly, `SearchStockCommand#SearchStockCommand(...)` constructor is called. 
3. The newly constructed `SearchStockCommand` invokes its `SearchStockCommand#parseIntoSearchKeyword(...)` and does not return anything.
4. The `CommandParser` then invokes `SearchStockCommand#execute(...)`, which then further invokes `Stock#searchStock(...)` from the Stock object.
5. The `Stock` object then self-invoke `Stock#checkIngredientInStock(...)` to see if there are ingredients that matches keyword that was passed into earlier.
6. If there are search results, `Stock#printSearchResult(...)` will display all the ingredients that matches the keyword given.
7. If there is no ingredient that matches the keyword, the program will display a different message to show the user.
8. Next, the time line returns back to `CommandParser` and the `SearchStockCommand` object is destroyed here.
9. If however, the user input did not input the search stock command correctly, `CommandParser` will invoke `CommandParser#errorCommand()` to notify the user.


#### 1.1.2 Design Considerations
##### Aspect: How search stock executes
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: List all ingredients that contains the keyword supplied.
  + Pros: Easy to implement.
  + Cons: All ingredients containing the keyword will be listed. This means that even if the keyword doesn't make sense, such as supplying "to", both potato and tomato will be listed since it contains "to".

* **Alternative 2**: The user supplies the exact ingredient name.
  + Pros: The ingredient that matches exactly with the keyword supplied will be listed.
  + Cons: The user have to input the ingredient name correctly each time he/she uses the search stock feature.

##### Aspect: Data structure to support the search stock feature.
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Use a `List` to store all possible ingredient names that contain the keyword supplied.
  + Pros: Easy to understand.
  + Cons: The `List` is derived by converting the existing stock (which is a `HashMap`) into an ArrayList. In order to print out the ingredient's name, quantity and price, methods such as `getKey()` and `getValue()` have to be used.

* **Alternative 2**: Use the existing `HashMap` data structure employed by the `stock` object.
  + Pros: We do not need to create a new `List` to display the relevant results.
  + Cons: Iterating a HashMap can be done by converting it to an EntrySet or by using an iterator. These, compared to `List`, is much less straightforward.

<a name="list-stock"></a>

### 1.2 List stock ingredients in descending quantity
#### 1.2.1 Proposed implementation

In the restaurant daily report, users can view all the ingredients presently in the stock by supplying the input `list stock`. The ingredients will be ordered in descending quantities, that is, the ingredient that has the highest quantity will be listed first and vice versa.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the listing mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. An empty `stock` will be initialized.

Step 2. The user executes `add stock; i/tomato; q/10; p/0.40;` command to add a tomato ingredient into the `stock`. Further, the user may add more ingredients into the current `stock`. Suppose the user executes `add stock; i/potato; q/0; p/0.40;` and `add stock; i/rice; q/55; p/0.40;` as well.

Step 3. The user can now view the current `stock` to see what ingredients are there in the stock. The user now executes `list stock`, which will display the following result in the image. In this case, `rice` has the highest quantity of `55`, which is listed first as compared to `potato`, which has the lowest quantity of `0`. This can be seen from the image below.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59989652/78977634-05e6d900-7b4b-11ea-8911-057c4ceb768b.png">
</p>

The listing mechanism process can be summarized in the following sequence diagram below:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59989652/78683798-52030500-7922-11ea-8a8d-3aaa5d7af486.png">
</p>

The sequence diagram can be interpreted as such:
1. `CommandParser` calls its own `CommandParser#parseCommand(...)`. 
2. Assuming the user input the list stock command correctly, `ListStockCommand#ListStockCommand()` constructor is called. 
3. The time line returns back to `CommandParser`.
4. The `CommandParser` then invokes `ListStockCommand#execute(...)`, which then further invokes `Stock#ListStock()` from the Stock object.
5. The `Stock` object then self-invoke `Stock#printStock()` to print the ingredients that are in the stock to display it to the user.
6. Note that within the method `Stock#printStock()`, the hashMap in the `Stock` will be sorted in descending ingredient quantity.
7. If there is no ingredient that in the `Stock`, the program will display a different message to show the user.
8. Next, the time line returns back to `CommandParser` and the `ListStockCommand` object is destroyed here.
9. If however, the user input did not input the search stock command correctly, `CommandParser` will invoke `CommandParser#errorCommand()` to notify the user.


Alternatively, the following class diagram also explains listing operation works:

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59989652/78975984-dda9ab00-7b47-11ea-8df4-f9510b8328ee.png" width="900">
</p>

1. When the user first runs the application, the `Main` object is initialized. The `Main` object then initializes the `ui`, the `stock` object and other objects such as `reservations` etc. in its `Main#start()` method. 
2. When the `stock` object is created, it will create a `LoadStock` object, which loads all data from the `report.txt` through `LoadStock#loadStockData(...)`.
3. Next, moving back to `Main`, through the `Main#runCommandUntilExit()` method, it then instructs the `ui` object to scan and read for user input. A `CommandParser` object is then initialized to parse this user input into a command.
3. The `CommandParser` object detects `list stock;` as the user input, in which it will then create a `ListStockCommand` object.
4. The `ListStockCommand` object is then executed via its `ListStockCommand#execute(...)` method, which takes in the `stock` object initialized previously and instructs it to list all ingredients through its `Stock#listIngredient()` method.
5. Within  the `Stock#listIngredient()` method, a temporary `List` data structure is used to convert from the `HashMap` in the `stock` object. The list is then sorted by supplying a `new Comparator` that compares the ingredient's quantity. Afterwards, the sorted list is then printed to be displayed to the user.




#### 1.2.2 Design Considerations

##### Aspect: How listing stock executes
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: List all ingredients in the stock in descending quantities.
  + Pros: The user is able to tell which ingredients are the least/most quickly. This can help to facilitate quicker decision making in terms of what ingredients to re-stock.
  + Cons: The current ingredients are listed in a specific ordering. A change in the ordering requirement would mean that a change in the implementation of the `comparator`.

* **Alternative 2**: List all ingredients in the stock without any ordering.
  + Pros: Easy to implement.
  + Cons: Hard to identity which ingredients that require re-stocking quickly.

##### Aspect: Data structure to support the search stock feature.
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Use a `List` to store all possible ingredient names.
  + Pros: Easy to understand.
  + Cons: The `List` is derived by converting the existing stock (which is a `HashMap`) into an ArrayList. In order to print out the ingredient's name, quantity and price, methods such as `getKey()` and `getValue()` have to be used.

* **Alternative 2**: Use the existing `HashMap` data structure employed by the `stock` object.
  + Pros: We do not need to create a new `List` to display the relevant results.
  + Cons: Iterating a HashMap can be done by converting it to an EntrySet or by using an iterator. Sorting it, however, as compared to `List`, is much less straightforward.

<a name="generate-profit"></a>

### 1.3 Generate profit for the day
#### 1.3.1 Proposed Implementation
In the restaurant daily report, the user can input the amount of items sold each day and a total profit will be generated, when the user inputs `profit`.

Below is an example usage scenario for the user.

Step 1. The user opens the program and an empty `sales` is initialized.

Step 2. The user can add sold items by inputting `sell dish; d/DISH; q/QUANTITY`. An example would be `sell dish; d/pasta; q/15;`.
The user can input as many sales as they like as long as the dish exists in the menu.

Step 3. The user can generate the profit by inputting `profit`.

The execution can be viewed in the sequence diagram below.
![](https://github.com/nguan1/tp/blob/master/docs/documentations/Ned/GenerateProfitSequenceDiagram.PNG)

#### 1.3.2 Design Considerations
##### Aspect: Using a separate class to perform sale commands
**Current Implementation**: Methods are stored in the sales class
* Pros: Easy to understand and implement.
* Cons: May make the sales class long and convoluted and may become difficult to find certain features or methods

**Alternative**: Commands are stored in separate classes
* Pros: Easier for a person who hasn't worked on the project to understand the structure
* Cons: Takes longer to implement


<a name="search-reservation"></a>

### 1.4 Search reservation
#### 1.4.1. Proposed Implementation

In the restaurant daily report, users can search against the reservation category by supplying either a reservation number or a date.

The feature implements the following operations:
* `SearchReservationCommand#parseInput()` - parse the user input for either reservation number or a date.
* `SearchReservationCommand#execute()` - search along the reservation list for the target reservation(s).

The following class diagram shows the structures relevant to the "search reservation" feature:
<p align="center">
    <img src="documentations\Sibing\ClassDiagramforSearchReservation.png" width="900">
</p>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the search mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. An empty `reservations` will be initialized.

Step 2. The user executes `add reservation; p/Peter; d/2020-03-12 12:00; n/3; c/98955555;` command to add a reservation into the `reservations` list.  
Further, the user may add more reservations into the current `reservations` list.  
Suppose the user executes `add reservation; p/Mary; d/2020-03-11 12:00; n/8; c/99998888;`  
and `add reservation; p/Lisa; m/no spicy food please; d/2020-03-12 12:00; n/3; c/98889999;` as well.

The following object diagram illustrates how the `reservations` list looks like:
<p align="center">
    <img src="documentations\Sibing\ObjectDiagramforSearchReservation.png" width="900">
</p>

Step 3. The user can now search against the current `reservations` list to see if an reservation is stored in the `reservations` list.  
If the user executes `search reservation; r/1;`, the mechanism is shown as follows:
* The `search reservation` command calls `SearchReservationCommand#execute()`.
* The branch with only valid reservation number will be executed, calling `ReservationList#getReservation(reservationNumber)` to fetch the target `Reservation` object.
* The following result with formatted information will be displayed in the image:

<p align="center">
    <img src="documentations\Sibing\SearchByIndex.png" width="300">
</p>

If the user executes `search reservation; d/2020-03-12;`, the mechanism is shown as follows:  
* The `search reservation` command calls `SearchReservationCommand#execute()`.
* The branch with only valid date will be executed, doing a linear search along the whole `reservations` list to pick out the `Reservation` objects with the same date.
* The following result will with formatted information be displayed in the image:

<p align="center">
    <img src="documentations\Sibing\SearchByDate.png" width="500">
</p>

If the user executes `search reservation; r/1; d/2020-03-13;`, the mechanism is shown as follows:  
* The `search reservation` command calls `SearchReservationCommand#execute()`.
* The branch with both valid date and reservation number will be executed.
* `SearchReservationCommand#execute()` is called to fetch the `Reservation` object in that reservation number.
* Date of the `Reservation` object is checked to see whether it matches the target date or not.
* In this case, the date does not match, so the following result will be displayed in the image:

<p align="center">
    <img src="documentations\Sibing\SearchByIndexnDate.png" width="300">
</p>

The following sequence diagram shows how `search reservation` operation works:

<p align="center">
    <img src="documentations\Sibing\SequenceDiagramforSearchReservation.png" width="900">
</p>

#### 1.4.2 Design Considerations
##### Aspect: How search reservation executes
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Access reservation by `ReservationList#getReservation(reservationNumber)` if reservation number is provided,
or do linear search along the reservation list for reservations with date matched.
  + Pros: Easy to implement and understand.
  + Cons: May have performance issues in terms of time usage when searching along the reservation list.

* **Alternative 2**: Create a `HashMap` with date as the key and all Reservation objects in that date as the value.
Once a new Reservation object is created, it will be added into the `HashMap` according to its date.
  + Pros: Easier for searching in terms of date.
  + Cons: Extra memory space is needed.


##### Aspect: Data structure to support the search reservation feature.
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Display all all `Reservation` objects that contain the reservation number or date provided to the screen directly.
  + Pros: Easy to implement and understand.
  + Cons: The target objects are not really "contained" in a data structure.

* **Alternative 2**: Use a `List` to store all `Reservation` objects that contain the reservation number or date provided.
  + Pros: Objects are stored in a data structure, which is easier to do operation on that specific collections of objects.
  + Cons: Extra memory space is needed.


<a name="search-dish"></a>

### 1.5 Search dish feature
#### 1.5.1 Proposed implementation

In restaurant daily report, a user can search from available menu items using the search dish commmand.

The search dish command takes in a keyword denoted by k/, and searches all dish names for dishes containing the keyword.

An example of the usage of search dish can be found below.

Step 1. User launches application. An empty `Menu` is initialized.

Step 2. User adds a menu item to the empty menu with `add dish; n/bacon pizza; i/cheese, bacon; p/7.00;`. Bacon pizza is now on the menu.

Step 3. User adds more menu items to the menu. For example, they can `add dish; n/chicken rice; i/chicken, rice; p/4.00;` and `add dish; n/pasta with bacon; i/pasta, bacon; p/6.00;`

Step 4. User searches the menu for any dish names containing a keyword. Let the user execute `search dish; k/bacon;`, the expected behavior can be found in the screenshot below.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48315922/77872867-3e66e880-7216-11ea-9003-e04bda089f24.png">
</p>

#### 1.5.2 Design Considerations
##### Aspect: Execution of search dish
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Search dish names for keyword
  + Pros: Intuitive use of search, easy to implement
  + Cons: If dishes are not named intuitively, such as `pasta with bacon`, feature becomes less useful

* **Alternative 2**: Search dish ingredients for keyword
  + Pros: Can find all dishes with a certain ingredient, which is useful if you really like something like `bacon` or are allergic to something like `cilantro`
  + Cons: Cannot easily find if the menu contains your favorite dish by name, like `ratatouille`

##### Aspect: Data structure in search dish
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Create a new temporary `HashMap<String, Dish>` that contains all dishes that match the search
  + Pros: Flexible to use later on, easy to implement
  + Cons: Potentially duplicate work as similar functionality could be accomplished without creating a new HashMap

* **Alternative 2**: Use original dish HashMap to identify dishes matching search
  + Pros: No duplicate work and we're always using the same HashMap
  + Cons: If we choose to further develop this feature later on, we'll have to do the search again because we did not save the matching items any way

### E.1. Launch and Shutdown<br/>
1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder.<br/>
2. Open a Terminal in that folder.<br/>
3. Run the command `java -jar [CS2113-T14-4][RestaurantDailyReport].jar`. The CLI should appear in a few seconds. It should be a welcome page.<br/>


<a name="e2-add-functionality"></a>
### E.2. Add Functionality

#### E.2.1 Adding a dish into menu
Adding a dish into menu.
* Test case: `add dish; n/pizza; i/cheese, sauce; p/7.00;`
    - Expected: Dish `pizza` successfully added.
* Test case: `add dish; n/pizza; i/cheese, sauce;`
    - Expected: Dish `pizza` will not be added. An error message will be displayed to request the user to input the correct format.
* Other incorrect add commands to try: `add dish; n/pizza; sauce;` or `add dish;i/cheese, sauce;`
    - Expected: The dish will not be added. An error message will be displayed accordingly.

#### E.2.2. Adding an ingredient into stock
Adding an ingredient into stock.
* Test case: `add stock; i/tomato; q/10; p/0.50;`
    - Expected: Ingredient `tomato` added into the stock.
* Test case: `add stock; i/tomato; q/10; p/0.50;`
    - Expected: The quantity of `tomato` increased to `20` due to the addition from the previous entry.
* Test case: `add stock; i/rice; q/10; p/randomNumber;`
    - Expected: `rice` will not be added into the stock. An error message will be displayed to request the user to type in the price
    as a double.
* Test case: `add stock; i/tOMaTO; q/10; p/0.50`
    - Expected: tOMaTO will be added into the stock. However, because of case-sensitivity, the quantity will not add on to the previous `tomato` 
    in the stock. A message will be displayed to inform the user of similar ingredient names already present in the stock.
* Other incorrect add commands to try: `add stock; i/tomato; q/LOL; p/10` or `add stock; i/tomato;`
    - Expected: The ingredient will not be added. An error message will be displayed accordingly.
* Extra Notes: 
    - The price of the ingredient can be overwritten. 
    For example:
    - Adding `add stock; i/apple; q/10; p/0.50` and then `add stock; i/apple; q/10; p/10.00` will overwrite the current price of `$0.50` to `$10.00`. 
    **This is intentional.**

#### E.2.3. Adding a reservation<br/>
Adding a reservation into an empty list.<br/>
* Prerequisite: Clear the `reservations` list using `clear reservation;` command to ensure the list is empty.
* Test case: `add reservation; p/Peter; d/2020-03-12 12:00; n/3; c/98955555;`<br/>
    - Expected: An unserved Reservation with reservation number [1] is added into the `reservations` list. Details of the added Reservation will display.
* Test case: `add reservation; p/David; d/2020-03-12 12:00; c/98887777;`<br/>
    - Expected: No Reservation is added. An error message displays to remind the user that "number of guests n/" is missing.
* Test case: `add reservation`<br/>
    - Expected: An error message displays to remind the user that it is a incorrect input format and the user can type `help` for the list of command.
* Other incorrect add commands to try: `add reservation; p/David d/2020-03-12 12:00; n/3; c/98887777;`, `add reservation;`, etc
    - Expected: No Reservation is added. Error messages indicating input missing displays.
