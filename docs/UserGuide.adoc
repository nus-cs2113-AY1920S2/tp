== Introduction

=== What is *ATAS*?
*ATAS* (Amazing Task and Assignment System) is a cross platform Command Line Interface (CLI) program that allows you to track your
assignments and events. *ATAS* is catered for students who want to maximise their productivity and cultivate
effective time management habits through a desktop application. *ATAS* is optimised for users who prefer to work with
the CLI.

=== What are the functions of *ATAS*?
Besides being able to store your assignment and event details in a text file, *ATAS* allows you to view your assignment
deadlines and event dates in a user-friendly calendar format. You can also list down events that are upcoming and assignments
that are due in the following week. Furthermore, *ATAS* displays the assignment and event details in an easy-to-read format
so that you would not miss out any important details at one glance.

=== How does *ATAS* solve the problem of our target audience?
University students often have piles of assignments and events that are difficult to manage and track efficiently.
*ATAS* allows students to enter one-liner commands to track these tasks quickly and therefore spend less of their time
logging and remembering important dates. Furthermore, students can view their upcoming events and assignments due to
manage their time wisely and allocate sufficient time to complete these tasks.

=== What is this guide for?
This guide aims to the educate you on how to use *ATAS* by providing examples and step-by-step instructions on all its features.

A summary of all the features available in *ATAS* can be found in <<Commands Summary>>.
Refer to <<Features>> for the detailed instruction of the various commands of *ATAS*.

== Features
====
*Command Format*

* Words in UPPER_CASE and wrapped in [square brackets] are parameters to be supplied by the user. +
   Example: In `assignment n/[NAME]`, `NAME` is an input given by user that can be used as `assignment n/user guide draft`.

* The INDEX that is used for various commands is a number used to identify a task within the list. The INDEX of a task is
shown on the left of each task whenever a `list` command is used.

* Dates supplied by the user must follow the format `DD/MM/YY`. +
Example: 01/03/20 represents the date 1st March 2020

* Times supplied by the user must follow the 24h format `HHmm`.
Example: 0259 represents the time 2:59am, and 2300 represents the time 11:00pm

* The parameters of a command cannot be reordered. +
Example: For the `assignment` command, typing `assignment n/Finals c/50% m/CS1231 d/30/10/20 1300` will result in an error as the COMMENTS parameter is in
the wrong position.
