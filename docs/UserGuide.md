(Written by: Matthew)

Schedules a new meeting at a specified time slot and adds it into the meeting list. You will need to key in 
`<Meeting Name>`, and specify the meeting time slot with `<Start Date>` `<Start Time>` `<End Date>` `<End Time>`.
* You can schedule a meeting on only the current week and the next week, for which your timetable can be displayed with the 
[`timetable`](#display-timetable-of-selected-contacts-timetable) and `more` commands
* Hence, `<Start Date>` and `<End Date>` represents the date number you wish to schedule the meeting on, within the current 
week and the next week, from the current date onwards. For example, if the date today is 27 April:
    * You can schedule a meeting on 29 April this week with `<Start Date>` and `<End Date>` as `29`. 
    * You can schedule a meeting on 6 May next week with `<Start Date>` and `<End Date>` as `6`.
    * You will not be able to schedule a meeting with `<Start Date>` and `<End Date>` as `26`. Even though 26 April is within
    this week, the date has passed. The future date 26 May is also not within the current week and the next week.
* `<Start Time>` and `<End Time>` should be in the 24-hour HH:MM format. For example, the time 3pm should be represented
as `15:00`.
* `<Meeting Name>` should be a single word with no whitespace character.
* Scheduling a meeting will modify only your (main user's) timetable, to be busy at the specified time slot. 
Timetables of other contacts will not be modified.

your timetable if you try to schedule a meeting during a time slot which you are busy for.
