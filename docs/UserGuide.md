## 1 Introduction

Diet Manager is an personal text-based chat-bot application used for managing an individual's diet.

Diet Manager is capable of the following functions:
* Profile -uses a user's profile information to personalise diet recommendations.
* Daily Food Record - record and store daily food intake.
* Food Nutrition Record - record and store food caloric information.
* Recipe Generator - generates a recommended recipe depending on a user's profile information.

## 2 Quick Start

* Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed in your Computer. <br>
* Download the latest version of DietManager-2.1.0.jar [here](https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2113-T15-4/tp/releases). <br>
* Open and run the jar file by entering the following command in Windows PowerShell or Git Bash:

        java -jar DietManager-2.1.0.jar

* The application will first search for a data directory to store all relevant data files. <br>
* If no `data` directory is found, it will create a new `data` directory.

        INFO: New Directory created: data

* Next there are 4 data files that the application will search for. If any of these files are present,
the application will read and load the data from these files. Otherwise, it will create new data files
to store the relevant information.
    * profile
    
            INFO: No existing Profile found, new file created: profile.txt
            
    * food-nutrition-record
            
            INFO: No existing Food Nutrition Record found, new file created: food-nutrition-record.txt

## 3.2 Daily Food Record Features

### Record meals
Records meals for the user(so they can refer record history and calculate calories intake later).

Format: `record-meal DATE TIMEPERIOD /FOOD1 {-- 10.0} /FOOD2 {-- 6.00} /...`

Attention:
* Parameters in `{}` is optional, it denotes the calories content of the `Food`. Also notice that you shouldn't use `{}`
in the actual input!
    * If a `Food` item can be found in our database, then no calories info needs to be 
provided. 
    * If no calories info is provided for a `Food` item not in our database, the `record`
    operation can still go on, but that `Food` item doesn't have calories info.
* You can record as many `Food` items as you want for a meal.
* `DATE` is restricted to the range of `Monday` to `Sunday` and `TIMEPERIOD` is restricted to
`morning/afternoon/night`.
* If a `Food` item is provided with incorrect calories info(like `/egg -- wow`), then this `Food` item
won't be recorded.

Example of usage: 

`record-meal Saturday morning /egg prata -- 5 /noodles -- xxx`

* Expected Output:

    ```
    You just record the meal in the morning of: SATURDAY.
    Some food/foods are not added due to invalid format.
    ```

* If enter `check-meal Saturday morning` right now, you expect to see:
    ```
    SATURDAY Morning: 
    Food: egg prata, Calories: 5.00cal
    For morning, total calculable calories intake: 5.00cal.
    ```

### Check meals
Check what the `profile` had eaten for a meal.

Format: `check-meal DATE TIMEPERIOD`

Attention:
* `DATE` is restricted to the range of `Monday` to `Sunday` and `TIMEPERIOD` is restricted to
  `morning/afternoon/night`.
  
Example of usage:

`check-meal Monday morning`

Expected Output:

* If the record doesn't exist:
    ```
    MONDAY Morning: 
    Oops, you have no record for this meal.
    For morning, there are no calculable calories data.
    ```
* If the record exists:
    ```
    MONDAY Morning: 
    Food: egg prata, Calories: 5.00cal
    Food: noodles, Calories: 2.00cal
    For morning, total calculable calories intake: 7.00cal.
    ```
### Clear all food records
Clear all the existing food records in a week.

Format: `clear-records`

Example of usage:

`clear-records`

* Expected Output:

    ```
    You have just cleared all food records in the week!
    ```

### Check required calories
Check the required calories for the current `profile` based on the activity level for the day.

Format: `check-required-cal DATE ACTIVITYLEVEL`

Attention:
```
`DATE` is restricted to the range of `Monday` to `Sunday`.
`ACTIVITYLEVEL` is restricted to `low`, `moderate` or `high`.
```

Example of usage:

`check-required-cal Monday low`

* Expected Output:

    * If the profile is trying to gain weight but is having insufficient calories for the day:
        ```
        Calories Intake and Requirement for SATURDAY:
        Total calculable calories intake for the entire day: 5.00cal.
        Calories requirement for high activity level: 2848.41cal.
        Ohh no!!! You have consumed too little calories.
        ```
    * If the profile is trying to lose weight but is having excess calories for the day:
        ```
        Calories Intake and Requirement for WEDNESDAY:
        Total calculable calories intake for the entire day: 2805.00cal.
        Calories requirement for moderate activity level: 2559.44cal.
        Ohh no!!! You have consumed too much calories
        ```
    * If the profile is working towards the weight goal and is having sufficient calories for the day:
        ```
        Calories Intake and Requirement for MONDAY:
        Total calculable calories intake for the entire day: 2860.00cal.
        Calories requirement for low activity level: 2270.47cal.
        Well done!!! You have consumed sufficient calories.
        ```

### Calculate calories
Calculates calories intake on a day or during a time period.

Format: 
* Option 1: `calculate {DATE}`
* Option 2: `calculate {DATE1}->{DATE2}`

Attention:
```
`DATE` is restricted to the range of `Monday` to `Sunday`.
```

Example of usage:
* First let's record some meals
  ```
  record-meal Monday morning /egg -- 2
  You just record the meal in the morning of: MONDAY.
  record-meal Monday night /Apple
  You just record the meal in the night of: MONDAY.
  record-meal Wednesday morning /prata -- 5 /beef -- 10
  You just record the meal in the morning of: WEDNESDAY.
  ```
* Then we calculate calories intake from Monday to Wednesday

  ```
  calculate Monday->Wednesday
  Your Calories intake during the given period is 19.00.
  ```
  * Notice `Apple` is in our database with calories info: 2.00


## 3.3 Food Nutrition Record Features

### List food database
Lists all foods and relevant calories info recorded in our database.

* Expected Output:
    ```
    You have added a new food into the database:
    Food: beef noodles, Calories: 7.0
    ```

*Attention: If calories info is incorrect, you expect to see:*
```

It has to be positive Integer or Float
```

### Delete food from database

Format: `delf FOODNAME`

Example of usage:

    You have just deleted beef noodles from the database.
    ```
* If `beef noodles` not in database:

    ```

## 3.4 Recipe Features

### Get a recommended recipe
Get a recommend recipe based on user's physical conditions and activity level.

Format: `new-recipe MAXIMUM_FODD_TYPES ACTIVITY_LEVEL`

Explanation: 
```
MAXIMUM_FOOD_TYPES is the maximum number of food types the user want to have in a meal. 
ACTIVITY_LEVEL has three levels : low/moderate/high. Based on different activity levels the app recommends different recipes.
```

Attention:
```
1.  The maximum number of allowed food types in a meal is 3.
2.  The recipe is generated randomly, so the same input is expected to get different recipe.
3.  If user is unsatisfied with the current recipe, just run the command again and get a new one.
```

Example of usage:
* `MAXIMUM_NUM` is 2, `ACTIVITY_LEVEL` is low:

    Input: `new-recipe 2 low`
    
    * Expected Output: 
        ```

## 4 FAQ

**Q**: What do I do if the application cannot be launched? 

**A**: Ensure that you have Java 11 and above installed on your device, 
and that you have the most updated version of the application.

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another device? 

**A**: All recorded user-related data will be stored in a folder when running the application. 
Simply copying and moving that specific folder would be sufficient.

**Q**: What if I want to use this application for multiple users on the same device? 

**A**: The application is localised and user data is dependent on the specific data files present.
Simply switch the data files to that of another user, or have multiple folders present for multiple users.

**Q**: Can I directly change the data in the data files? 

**A**: You can, but it is strongly discouraged as it could lead to the data file being corrupt and the application
being forced to delete the data file and create a new one.
