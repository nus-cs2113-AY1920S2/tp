## 1. Introduction

  OrgaNice! is a task manager integrated with a Study Area search function and a Notes Taking feature. 
  You can use it to manage your tasks, be it events or deadlines. On top of that, 
  it is capable of assisting students in finding Study Areas that meet their desired criteria.
  Also, our Notes Taking feature provides you with a handy way to record notes based on school modules fast.<br>
  
  Our application supports 2 types of tasks, they are as follows: 
 * **Deadline** Tasks - Used to denote a task that needs to be finished by a deadline.
    
     E.g, Assignments, Projects etc that are due on a specific date.

<a name="schedule"></a>

### 3.12. Schedule tasks
If you have a bunch of assignments, projects and exams happening over the next few weeks and are stressed out with planning

Then a set of lines are displayed which specify the format to be used to specify the new tasks to be scheduled. After you input the relevant data. The application would find a feasible schedule satisfying your constraints if it is possible to do so. If it is possible, the list of events that was created when the task were scheduled is added to the current list of tasks. If it is impossible, a message to alert the user is specified too.
If the wrong format is used an invalid command alert would be displayed.

Example of usage: 

`schedule 3` - Schedule 3 tasks

    ________________________________________________________________________________________________
    
#### Future Enhancements
   The current version of the application doesn't take into account the other tasks present, however, the priority 
values can still be used to decide the more important task. In v3.0 our application will support scheduling tasks 
while avoiding tasks present previously and also add support for tasks to be scheduled preemptively (i.e, tasks can be 
scheduled over non-contiguous days).

   * -s {size}  : To locate a study area that can facilitate the size of pax entered.
   * -p         : To locate a study area based on the availability of ports.
   * -i         : To locate a study area that are indoors.
   * -o         : To locate a study area that are outdoors.

Note: 

{name\address\faculty} {flags} is the basic format to search for Study Areas. You can enter either argument, or both.
If both arguments are specified, flags will have to precede either the name,address or faculty.

#### Usage

#### Search by name, address or faculty 

Example of usage:
`bux`

Expected Outcome:

    ________________________________________________________________________________________________
         Here are the available study areas!

         Ground Level
         Faculty: Utown
         Port: true
         Indoor: false
         Maximum number of Pax: 4

         Indoor: true
         Maximum number of Pax: 5
         __________________________________________________________
         Please enter the location for your desired study area.
    ________________________________________________________________________________________________

#### Search by name, address or faculty and with flags

Example of usage:
`bux -o`

Expected Outcome:

    ________________________________________________________________________________________________
         Here are the available study areas!
         __________________________________________________________
         Name: Opposite Town Green (Outside Starbucks)
         Address: 2 College Avenue West Education Resource Centre,
         Ground Level
         Faculty: Utown
         Port: true
         Indoor: false
         Maximum number of Pax: 4
         __________________________________________________________
         Please enter the location for your desired study area.
    ________________________________________________________________________________________________

__NOTE__: When using this format, flags must always come after the location, name or address. Else, the system will 
return an error message.

### Search by flags only 

Example of usage : 
`-s 6`

Expected output:

    ________________________________________________________________________________________________
         Here are the available study areas!
         __________________________________________________________
         Name: EA Level 4
         Address: 9 Engineering Drive 1,EA, Level 4, Outside Staff
         Offices
         Faculty: Engineering
         Port: true
         Indoor: false
         Maximum number of Pax: 6
         __________________________________________________________
         Please enter the location for your desired study area.
    ________________________________________________________________________________________________

#### Future Enhancements

   The current implementation does not include real-time availability of the study areas. In version 3.0 we hope to be
   able to retrieve real-time availability of public study areas, like the ones in U-Town. In order to do so we would 
   require access to real-time data like CCTV monitors of the study areas to detect if there is an available seat at 
   a specific point of time at a specific area. Also, due to time constraint, we were not able to gather an exhaustive 
   list for the study area. At version 3.0 we aim to reach full breadth for the data on study areas in NUS.

#### 3.15.3 To escape from Calendar View Command 

In any case that you wish to exit calendar mode after entering it, you can enter "bye" to exit.

Example of usage: 

`bye`

Expected output:

    ________________________________________________________________________________________________
         You are now back in main interface. Enter "help" for a
         list of supported commands
    ________________________________________________________________________________________________


[comment]: # (@@author )     
<a name="exit"></a>

### 3.16. Exit the Application / Study Area interface
You use this command to exit the application. Before the actual application is exited the 
tasks currently in the list are stored in a file. This command is used for exiting the main interface and the
secondary study area search interface.

#### Usage

#### `bye` - Exit the Application / Study Area interface

The command, when issued, performs an exit.
Upon success, a successful message similar to the one in the example would appear and the application would be exited.
If the wrong format is used an invalid command alert would be displayed.

Example of usage: 
`bye`

Expected outcome:
Depending on the current mode of execution, the application would either be exited successfully or would return to the main interface.
A response similar to the following one would appear:
1) If the 'bye' command is given in the main interface

         Goodbye! Hope to see you again!

### 3.17. Saving the data
The tasklist is saved automatically before the application is executed. There is no need to save manually.

<a name="clear-old-tasks"></a>

### 3.18. Clearing old tasks
The tasklist only includes the tasks which have date beyond the current date. This removes the need for you to manually find and delete the old tasks.

## 4. FAQ
Q: When loading the interface on the command line, why was the logo cut off and certain format disrupted?<br>
A: You need to be using the software at full screen before launching the software. If this happens, exit the software,
go to fullscreen mode, then restart the software. Everything should run smoothly.
<br>

Q: How to transfer the task list data from one computer to an other computer?<br>
A: Just copy the "TaskList.txt" file which could be found at the library folder under directory
   as the jar file and paste it to the library folder under the location containing the jar file in the other
   computer. This should transfer the required data.
<br>   
Q: The software says that library/TaskList.txt does not exist. What do I do?<br>
A: Go to the software's root folder and check to see if the library folder exists. If so, delete the library folder 
   and rerun the software. The software would have created a fresh set of data files required for the system to run.
<br>   
Q: The software says that library/locations.txt or library/dictionary.txt does not exist. What do I do?<br>
A: Go to the software's root folder and check to see if the library folder exists. Proceed to check if TaskList.txt 
   exist. If so, transfer it to a temporary folder. Delete the library folder and rerun the software. Transfer the 
   content from the old TaskList.txt to the new TaskList.txt
<br>   
Q: How do I import and export Notes?<br>
A: Notes are stored in library/notes.txt. To export and import Notes, simply transfer this file to another device 
   with OrgaNice! installed in the same directory /library/. You can open the text file to see how we actually 
   structure our notes information inside to write your own notes.txt.
