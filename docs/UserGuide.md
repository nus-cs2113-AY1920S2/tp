# Introduction  
This **Nuke** application is a simple yet powerful task management system that is dedicated to providing **NUS students** efficient organisation of _modules_ and _tasks_.<br>
You will be interacting with the application via the command line. With the **Nuke** application, you will be able to perform various operations to manage your _modules_ and _tasks_ such as adding, deleting and listing your  _modules_ and _tasks_. You may also add additional properties to your _tasks_ such as _files_, _deadlines_, and _priorities_.<br>
**Nuke** facilitates users by automatically sorting user-added _tasks_ and displaying the most important and urgent ones to the users. In the long term, it strives to enhance the quality of NUS students’ lives by serving as the one-stop platform for efficient management of module tasks.<br>
If you are an **NUS student** and have not tried out **Nuke** yet...  
What are you waiting for? Give **Nuke** a shot, and you will see how amazing it is!  
    
  


# General Usage  
This section will explain the fundamental structure of the **Nuke** application, and important guidelines to follow to ensure smooth usage of the application.  

## Nuke Structure
**Nuke** follows the structure of a **Directory Tree** _(i.e. folder sub-folder structure)_. This Directory Tree comprises various levels:

#### <u>Directory Levels Table</u>  
  
| Directory Level | Description                                                                      |  
|:---------------:|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| **Root**        | The **base** of the Directory Tree. Only **one** root exists in the entire Tree.<br>Added _modules_ are in this level. |  
| **Module**      | The **second** level of the Directory Tree.<br>Added _categories_ are in this level.   |  
| **Category**    | The **third** level of the Directory Tree.<br>Added _tasks_ are in this level.    |  
| **Task**        | The **last** level of the Directory Tree.<br>Added _files_ are in this level.       |  

<br>

```
	// Maybe I will add a sample Directory Tree diagram here
``` 
 
### Root   
The **Root** Directory is the **base** of the entire Directory Tree. Only **one** root exists in the entire Tree. _Modules_ are added into this level into a **Module List**. A _module_ consists of both a_module code_ and a _module title_. 
> **Note**: Only **NUS modules** are allowed to be added in **Nuke**.  
  
### Module
The **Module** Directory is the **second** level of the Directory Tree.  Each _module_ has a **Category List** that has several _categories_ to categorise your _tasks_, such as Lecture, Tutorial and Assignment, so that you can further organise your _tasks_. A _category_ consists of a _name_ and a _priority_ to indicate the importance of the _tasks_ in that _category_.

### Category
The **Category** Directory is the **third** level of the Directory Tree. Each _category_ has a **Task List** that can contain any number of _tasks_, which are ideally related to the _category_. A _task_ has several attributes, namely the _description_, _deadline_ of the _task_ if any, _priority_ and the _done status_ of the _task_.

### Task
The **Task** Directory is the **last** level of the Directory Tree. Each _task_ can have _files_ attached to the it. _Files_ are stored in the **File List**. The _file_ must have a _file name_ and the _path_ to the _file_.

#### <u>Other Notes</u>
The **Nuke** application adheres to this Directory Tree structure strictly. It is important to note that you can only add a directory into a directory which is **_exactly_ one level lower**. For example, you can only add a _task_ into the **Category** directory, and not directly into the **Module** directory.<br>
Normally, you would need to enter the full _directory path_ in order to add and delete _modules_, _categories_, _tasks_ and _files_. To make the process more efficient, **Nuke** enables you to traverse about the various directories via the [Change Directory](#6-change-directory) command so that you can add and delete the corresponding items directly without having to enter the full _directory path_.
<br>

## Command Format  
In this User Guide, the format for each feature _(command)_ will usually be of this form:
`CommandWord <attribute0> -Prefix1 <attribute1> ... [ -Prefix2 <attribute2> ... ]`

### Command Word
Each command you give to **Nuke** has to begin with its corresponding unique **command word**. This helps **Nuke** to know that you want it to execute a particular command.

### Attribute
**Attributes** are information to be provided in the command. An **attribute** for the command will be wrapped in angular brackets `< >` to help you to recognise it.

### Prefix
A **prefix** is used to provide additional supplementary information to the command. More information on the various **command prefixes** can be found [here](#command-prefixes).

### Optional
Some **attributes** and **prefixes** are _optional_ and the command can still execute properly even when omitted. However, they may be useful if you want to provide a more specific information to the command. Optional **attributes** and **prefixes** will be wrapped in square brackets `[ ]` to help you to recognise them.

<br>

## Command Prefixes  
On many occasions, you may be required to enter more information to describe the commands you give to **Nuke**. For example, when adding a _task_, you may need to specify the _module_ and _category_ to add the _task_ into. You may also want to include additional attributes such as the _deadline_ and _priority_. All these information can only be recognised by **Nuke** if they are preceded by the correct **prefix**.<br>
All **command prefixes** in **Nuke** begins with a `-` and followed by a **letter**. Below is the exhaustive list of **command prefixes** and general information that should follow after. 

#### <u>Command Prefix Table</u>  
  
| Command Prefix | General Definition                                               |  
|:--------------:|------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| `-m`           | The _module code_ of the _module_                                |  
| `-c`           | The _name_ of the _category_                                     |  
| `-t`           | The _description_ of the _task_                                  |  
| `-f`           | The _path_ of the _file_                                         |  
| `-d`           | The _deadline_ of the _task_                                     |  
| `-p`           | The _priority_ of the _category_ or _task_                       |
| `-e`           | To indicate whether filtering is done **exactly**                |  
| `-a`           | To indicate whether filtering is done across **all directories** |

# Miscellaneous Information  
  
## Help  
In the event that you ever forget the usage of a command, you can look it up within the **Nuke** program itself. All you need to do is to enter the *keyword* `help`, followed by the command you wish to query.     
  
<br>  
  
## Exiting the Nuke Program  
Exiting the **Nuke** program is simple. Simply enter `bye` to exit.  
Upon exiting, the program will [save](#saving) your entire Directory List into a file in your device.  
  
<br>  
  
## Loading and Saving  
The **Nuke** program loads and saves your entire Directory List **automatically**, so there is no explicit way to freely load or save your file.    

### Loading 
Loading is done once you start up the **Nuke** program. The data from the saved *directory list file* in your device is read to initialise your Directory List from when it was last saved.
  
### Saving  
Saving is done upon executing each of your commands in the **Nuke** program. Your Directory List will be saved into a *directory list file* in your device.    
  
<br>  
  
## Date Time Formats  
Any *date time* data that you provide has to adhere to certain formats pre-defined by the **Nuke** program. Failure to do so will likely result in the program to be unable to recognise your input command, and a warning will be shown.    
Instances when you may need to enter a *date time* will be when adding a _deadline_ to your _tasks_.
    
Here are the following *date time* formats:  
    
### Date Formats  
There are **two** types *date* formats allowed.  
  
#### 1. Words  
You may enter **only** the following *date* words.  
- `today` or `tdy` -- represents the <u>current</u> date  
- `tomorrow` or `tmr` -- represents the <u>next</u> date  
- `yesterday` or `yst` -- represents the <u>previous</u> date  
  
> **Note**: All dates are taken with reference to the current date on your device.  
  #### 2. Standard Date Format  
This refers to the typical dates that are represented with **numbers** and **delimiter symbols**.    
    
In this **Nuke** program, *dates* should be in the order of **day**, **month**, then an <u>optional</u> **year**. If the **year** is not provided, the program will automatically assume it to be the **current year**.  Also, the **day**, **month** and **year** should only be entered as **numbers** and not words *(e.g. January is not accepted for the **month** attribute)*.  
    
Regarding **delimiters**, the program will **only** consider `/` and `-` as valid delimiters for *dates*.  Delimiters are <u>optional</u> and may be omitted provided you include the **year** of the *date* *(e.g. 1/1/20, 1/1 and 010120 are accepted, but not 0101).*  
  
An **exhaustive** list of the standard *date* formats is given below for your reference.  
```
 dd/MM/yyyy, d/MM/yyyy, dd/M/yyyy, d/M/yyyy,   
 dd/MM/yy, d/MM/yy, dd/M/yy, d/M/yy,  
 dd/MM, d/MM, dd/M, d/M, dd-MM-yyyy, d-MM-yyyy, dd-M-yyyy, d-M-yyyy,   
 dd-MM-yy, d-MM-yy, dd-M-yy, d-M-yy,  
 dd-MM, d-MM, dd-M, d-M, ddMMyyyy, ddMMyy
 ```  
  
### Time Formats  
The **Nuke** program accepts most time formats that are represented with **numbers**, **delimiter symbols** and <u>optional</u> **am-pm markers**.    
    
The *time* should be in the order of  **hour**, then **minute**. The **seconds** attribute of *time* should **not** be given. The **minute** attribute must be a **double** digit *(i.e. single digits must be padded with a 0 in front)*. The **minute** attribute is also <u>optional</u>, and should it be omitted, the **Nuke** program will automatically set the **minute** to be 0. Both the **12-h** format and the **24-h** format are valid *time* formats for this program.    
    
Regarding **delimiters**, the program will **only** consider `:` and `.` as valid delimiters for *time*.  Delimiters are <u>optional</u> and may be omitted.  
  
Lastly, the **am-pm marker** is an <u>optional</u> attribute, and should it be omitted, the **Nuke** program will automatically assume the *time* to follow the **24-h** format.  
  
An **exhaustive** list of the *time* formats is given below for your reference.  
```  
 h:mma, H:mma, H:mm, h.mma, 
 H.mma, H.mm, hmma, Hmma, Hmm, 
 ha, Ha, H
 ```
