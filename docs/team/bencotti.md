### Code contribution
* Code Contributed: [Functional Code](https://nus-cs2113-ay1920s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/#search=bencotti&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-03-01&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=false)
* Basic skeleton code
* Storage class: saves task to JSON file and rebuild list when needed
* Parser class: Parses user input and returns respective command - improved performance by including validation for certain commands in this phase
* CalendarCommand: prints calendar view and tasks for day of month
* Calendar Component: CalendarParser, GenerateCalendar - very difficult to visualise, and manipulate strings in order to get table output
* DoneCommand : Create two task types: taskNonClass and Class
* JUnit Tests: added tests for Calendar, Done, Exit commands

### Enhancements implemented
* LocalDate, LocalTime update : Update code to work with proper date object, and helper methods - complete overhaul of certain methods to work with new variable type
* More validation methods : easier validation before logic of code even runs to improve performance

### Contribution to documentation:
* Hyperlinks and structure enhancement
* Minor part in Features
* Command summary
* Dev Ops
    * Appendix C: User Stories
    * Appendix D: Non-Functional Requirements

### Contribution to the DG:
* Formatting of the document
* Calendar implementation 
* Architecture of program - All sections within architecture less storage component


### Contributions to team-based tasks:
* Active participation during tutorials and answers questions online and offline about new concepts
* Keeping team on track and asking for member's availability for meetings
* Helping team members debug intelliJ issues 

#### Review/mentoring contributions:
* Reviews on github
* Responsiveness on github issue discussion

#### Contributions beyond the project team
