## Project - Exam Study Companion (ESC)

## Overview
Exam Study Companion (ESC) is a command-line based app that is designed to help students preparing for upcoming exams. The app is written in Java and requires JDK 11 to run.


## Summary of Contributions
### Major Enhancement: Added the subject/subjectlist class
+ What it does: allows user to store a subject tag to each card added and has the ability to add, delete and list subjects. 

+ Justification: This feature improves the product because in real life, revision is done according to subjects.

+ Highlights: This enhancement needs to work along side the Card/Cardlist class which alrealy exists. It needs to limit the access to Card/Cardlist class as well to conform with the design.

### Major Enhancement: Added the editCardCommand class
+ What it does: allows user to edit an existing card.

+ Justification: The feature improves usability as users can now edit a card instead of removing it and add a new one.

+ Highlights: This enhancement has a new format of inputs therefore existing functions to extract data from the command needs to be adjusted.

### Major Enhancement: added the UI class
