* **Enhancement added:**
    1. `Add` functionality:
    - Allows flexibility in the ordering of the parameters specified from the user. For example: Entering `add stock; i/tomato; q/10; p/1.00;` and `add stock; i/tomato; 
    p/1.00; q/10;` are both acceptable.
    - Customizes error messages according to the input supplied from the user. For example: Entering `add stock; i/;` will display the message: `"The user's input must specify 
    the ingredient's name!"`. Entering `add stock; i/tomato; q/-10; p/1.00;` will display the message: `"Please enter a positive value for the quantity to be added!"`
    - Displays a reminder to the user if the user input a similar ingredient name that exists in the stock. This is inform the user if he/she has made a typo that was undesired.
    For example: Entering `add stock; i/ToMATo; q/10; p/1.00;` will display the following result, if tomato already exists in the stock:   
    <p align="center">

    </p>    
    2. `Delete` functionality:
    - Allows flexibility in the ordering of the parameters specified from the user. For example: entering `delete stock; i/tomato; q/10;` and `delete stock; i/tomato;` 
    are both acceptable.
    - Allows the user to delete the ingredient by quantity count or remove from the stock entirely. For example: Entering `delete stock; i/tomato;` removes tomato entirely from the stock. 
   Entering `delete stock; i/tomato; q/1;` reduces the quantity of tomatoes in the stock by 1. 
    - Customizes error messages according to the input supplied from the user. For example: Entering `delete stock; i/;` will display the message: `"The user's input must specify the
 ingredient's name!"` while entering `delete stock; i/tomato; q/-10;` will display the message: `"Please enter a positive value for the quantity to be added!"`
    
    3. `List` functionality
    - Lists ingredients in the stock from the highest quantity to the lowest quantity.

    4. `Search` functionality
    - Takes into account case-sensitivity of the keyword supplied from the user when searching against the stock.

    5. `Load` functionality
    - Loads the stock-related data from the `report.txt` file.

    2. **Developer guide contribution:**
