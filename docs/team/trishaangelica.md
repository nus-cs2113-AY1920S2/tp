# Labi Trisha Angelica Vergara - Project Portfolio
## PROJECT: SHOCO 

## Overview

SHOCO is a desktop application used for managing and planning of shopping lists and budgets. Users interact with it through the use of a command-line interface (CLI), the program is written in Java and has bout 5 kLoC.

## Summary of Contributions
* **Major enhancement 1:** Included the **ability to edit items** in the shopping list.
    * What it does: Allows the user to update values of an item in the shopping list. Such values include the description, price and quantity of an item.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user may make mistakes when adding an item (e.g typos made) and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify such mistakes.
    * Highlights: This enhancement allows the user to update any value of an item as the edit command does not require any order in its input (e.g alphabetical ordering of delimiters).
* **Minor enhancement 1:** Negative values entered for price and quantity are not accepted. This is for a realistic approach as items will never have negative prices and/or quantities in a real life scenario.

* **Major enhancement 2:** Added the **help function** for the SHOCO application.
    * What it does: Lists all acceptable commands, their purpose, valid parameters and examples of usage.   
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because the user may forget how certain functions work and so, the app should provide a convenient way for them to check on the accepted command format.
     With the help feature embedded in the application, users need not solely rely on the SHOCO User Guide for help when they are in doubt.
    * Highlights: This enhancement includes examples of command usages which makes the accepted command formats much more comprehensible to the user.  

* **Code contributed:** [[Functional code]](https://nus-cs2113-ay1920s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=trishaangelica&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-03-01&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=trishaangelica&tabRepo=AY1920S2-CS2113T-T13-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D)

#### 3.2 Edit feature
##### 3.2.1 Current implementation

The edit feature is implemented using an <code>EditCommand</code> class. This class extends from the main
<code>Command</code> class. The <code>Item</code> object to be edited is identified by the index number provided 
in the user input. In addition to the index number, the user input **must also contain at least one** of these parameters: 
*description*, *price*, *quantity*. 

The process is as follows:

1. <code>Duke</code> class receives user input from the <code>Ui</code> class. 
2. A <code>Parser</code> object is created.
3. <code>Duke</code> calls <code>Parser#parseCommand()</code> method to instantiate an <code>EditCommand</code> object based on the user input.
4. <code>Duke</code> class calls the <code>EditCommand#execute()</code> method.
5. In the <code>EditCommand#execute()</code> method, the <code>Item</code> object is retrieved through
<code>ShoppingList#getItem()</code>. The original description / price / quantity of the item is overwritten 
with the new values from the user input through the use of the <code>Item</code> class setter methods.
6. The <code>Item</code> object with its new values is stored back to the <code>ShoppingList</code> object.

The following sequence diagram below shows how the edit feature works. The details of updating the values of an item
have been omitted from the diagram. Those details are shown in a separate sequence diagram.

![Edit Feature](../images/Edit_v1_PPP.png)

The separate sequence diagram below shows how an item is updated with new values.

![Edit Feature SD](../images/Edit_SD_v1_PPP.png)


##### 3.2.2 Design considerations

##### Aspect: Data structure to support the edit feature

- Alternative 1 (current choice): Only parameters present in user input are treated as values to update.
  
  - Pros: User has the flexibility to choose which variables he/she wishes to update.
  
  - Cons: Might significantly increase the code base as there is a need to check for the 
    presence of the variable in user input.
 
 
- Alternative 2: Require all values of an <code>Item</code> object to be updated and parameters must be in alphabetical
order.
  - Pros: Will have less code to deal with having no additional parsing of the input string.
  
  - Cons: Less user flexibility; user must input all parameters even if he/she does not wish to update certain
  variables.


Reason for choosing alternative 1: By allowing users to update any values they want, it provides them with greater convenience and freedom as they do not need to follow strict command "rules/order". Furthermore, having greater freedom on input values makes it a hassle-free process for the users.

&nbsp;
 
#### 3.10 View help feature
##### 3.10.1 Current implementation

The help feature is implemented using a <code>HelpCommand</code> class which extends the main
<code>Command</code> class. The <code>HelpCommand</code> class shows the program usage instructions to the user.

 The process is as follows:
 1. <code>Duke</code> receives user input from <code>Ui</code>.
 2. <code>Duke</code> calls <code>Parser#parseCommand()</code>. If the user input fails to match any of the 
 correct command keywords (<code>ADD</code>, <code>EDIT</code>, <code>DEL</code> etc.), or if the input matches the 
  <code>HELP</code> command keyword, a <code>HelpCommand</code> object will be instantiated.
 3. <code>Duke</code> calls <code>HelpCommand#execute()</code>.
 4. <code>HelpCommand#execute()</code> lists all the accepted command format SHOCO recognizes, their purpose and 1 or more examples
of usage.

The following sequence diagram below shows how the help feature works. Note, the <code>Ui</code> class is
omitted in the sequence diagram to emphasise on the other classes:

![Help Feature](../images/Help_v1_PPP.png)

##### 3.10.2 Design considerations

##### Aspect: Data structure to support the help feature

- Alternative 1 (current choice): Object-oriented style with a separate class for <code>HelpCommand</code>
 
  - Pros: Easy to add the help feature without having to change the logic of the code much as each command
  object is treated as a black box
  
  - Cons: Might significantly increase the code base with another class being added


- Alternative 2: Implement help feature in the <code>Duke</code> or <code>Parser</code> class

  - Pros: Will have less code to deal with as a new function is simply created in the <code>Duke</code> class
  
  - Cons: Code becomes less organised since for every other command that we have implemented, <code>Duke</code> class
  simply executes those commands as black boxes, without worrying about their internal details

Reason for choosing alternative 1: By abstracting out different command types as separate classes, we could work better in parallel and also be able to spot bugs more easily as each class deals with a different functionality
