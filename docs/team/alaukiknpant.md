## Overview

TechToday Information Tracker(TTIT) is a Command Line Application(CLI) designed for lifelong learners of technology breakthroughs, computer science or closely related disciplines to manage information about technology. TTIT not only helps a user access and save latest information about articles and jobs from HackerNews, but can also be used to save articles/jobs/notes that the user wants to input themselves.

## Summary of Contributions 

### Code contributed: 
* designed and implemented all the major features for the project [(find code for my contributions here)](https://nus-cs2113-ay1920s2.github.io/tp-dashboard/#breakdown=true&search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2020-03-01&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=false&groupSelect=groupByRepos&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=alaukiknpant&tabRepo=AY1920S2-CS2113-T14-2%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D)

### Enhancements: 
* implemented the view feature for [v1.0](https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2113-T14-2/tp/releases/tag/v1.0)
* implemented and wrote all of the major features of the application including `help`, `save`, `create`, `list`, `delete` and `addinfo` from scratch for [v2.0](https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2113-T14-2/tp/releases/tag/v2.0) and [v2.1](https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2113-T14-2/tp/releases/tag/v2.1) 
* 

#### Notable enhancement:
* added the ability to view new articles/jobs using [Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API)	      

#### What it does: 
* allows the user to view 6 latest articles and job updates from HackerNews when prompted with the relevant `view` command		

#### Justification:
* This feature improves the product significantly because a user can not only save job questions/articles that they find interesting manually, but also make a quick browse and save the latest articles from a quality news source like HackerNews. 	

* **Highlights:** This enhancement complements existing functionalities and commands because you can view new articles/jobs from the internet and save them instead of just having the feature of manually adding articles. This enhancement also lets the user quickly save latest news/jobs without having to spend time manually entering the details. This enhancement required understanding the relevant API documentation. Apart from the HackerNews API documentation, I used the following sources to use the API in TechToday.
