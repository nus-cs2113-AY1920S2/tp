Summary of contributions
========================

-   **Major enhancement**: added **the ability to undo/redo previous commands**

    -   What it does: allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.

    -   Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.

    -   Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

    -   Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*

-   **Minor enhancement**: added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
