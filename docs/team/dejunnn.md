## Contributions to the User Guide

Reproduce the parts in the User Guide that you wrote. 
This can include features you implemented as well as features you propose to implement.
The purpose of allowing you to include proposed features is to 
provide you more flexibility to show your documentation skills. 
e.g. you can bring in a proposed feature just to give you an opportunity 
to use a UML diagram type not used by the actual features.

---

## Contributions to the Developer Guide

Reproduce the parts in the Developer Guide that you wrote. 
Ensure there is enough content to evaluate your technical documentation skills and UML modelling skills. 
You can include descriptions of your design/implementations, possible alternatives, pros and cons of alternatives, etc.
