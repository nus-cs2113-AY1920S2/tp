## Overview

TechToday Information Tracker(TTIT) is a Command Line Application(CLI) designed for lifelong learners of Computer Science or closely related disciplines to manage information about technology. TTIT not only helps a user access and save latest information about articles and jobs from the HackerNews API, but can also be used to save articles/jobs/notes that the user wants to input themselves. The application's main goal is to help the user manager all their technology related information in the form of articles, jobs, and notes that either the application provides, or the user inputs themselves.

#### Major Enhancements

***Developed major features such as `save`, `delete`, and `list` for v1.0***

  * What it does: the `save` features saves articles from the viewed articles list into the saved articles list. The `delete` feature deletes a particluar article from the saved article list. The `list` feature would list all saved articles. 
  
  * Justification: These features allow the user to interact with the application my modifying what they have saved and being able to visually see their saved information. 
  
  * Highlights: This was the first version of these features, which creates a reference/backbone to future developments of these features. 
  
  * Credits: I referenced my own code that I used in the iP of this course. 

***Developed Ui class and functions to help parse through user input***

  * What it does: Takes in the user input and returns a strimmed string object that represents the command the user wishes the  program to execute. 
  
  * Justification: These features simplifies the way the developer is able to parse through the user input. It makes it easier for the developer to parse and differentiate between the different commands. 
  
  * Highlights: This feature is always used in the application since it is needed to retrieve user input. 
  
  * Credits: I referenced my own code that I used in the iP of this course. 

***Implemented all features for v1.0 to ensure that user input would execute all features/commands***

  * What it does: Designed the initial switch cases to execute the different commands for the application
  
  * Justification: Although features had been developed, I pieced them all together in main code of v1.0 to ensure the correct commands would execute based on user input.  
  
  * Highlights: This was a crucial piece in ensuring that the application ran and worked for the 1st version release. 
  
  * Credits: I referenced my own code that I used in the iP of this course. 

***Wrote all test cases***

  * What it does: Tests the different commands and ensures they are function as they intend to be. 
  
  * Justification: Test code is a crucial part of any project to ensure that the code is bug free and works as it is intended. 
 
***Wrote all exceptions*** 

  * What it does: Outputs error messages when the user types an incorrect/invalid command in the command prompt 
  
  * Justification: This catches invalid commands inputed by the user before it creates a crash in the application. 
  
  * Highlights: I added exceptions in all places where they were needed and messages that the program would output when the user typed something incorrectly. 

### Contributions to documentation: 

* Edited the user guide and added additional blocks of code [User Guide](https://ay1920s2-cs2113-t14-2.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html) 
* Edited the Developer Guide and contributed to the following sections: "Glossary", "Non-Functional Requirements", "Tests", and "Instructions for Manual Testing", of the [Developer Guide](https://ay1920s2-cs2113-t14-2.github.io/tp/DeveloperGuide.html)
