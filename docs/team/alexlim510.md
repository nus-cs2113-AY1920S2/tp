### Enhancements Implemented
- Major enhancement: added the ability to parse user inputs
  - What it does: Parses the user inputs into the correct parameters for the corresponding commands.
  - Justification: The application must be able to process user inputs so as to produce the desired outcome.
  - Highlights: This enhancement affects all commands in the application. Extensive exception handling is required to prevent users from making erroneous inputs.   
- Major enhancement: implemented the general structure of the command classes
  - What it does: The command classes follow a structured inheritance hierarchy system with the required attributes and methods.
  - Justification: To improve the code for maintenance, integration and testing, it should follow certain OOP principles such as the single responsibility principle.  
  - Highlights: This enhancement can ease the maintenance of the code. Moreover, the addition of new commands also become easier with the help of the open close principle.
