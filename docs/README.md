# History Flashcard

History Flashcard (HF) is for those who are studying history subjects to create flashcards which summarize the most important information for historical events, figures and artifacts. HF is optimized for those who prefer to use a simple Command Line Interface (CLI). It includes features that help with memory retention and make information convenient to review, e.g. the ability to organize historical events into timelines and store summarized biographies of history figures.
