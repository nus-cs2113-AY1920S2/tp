# Kitchen Helper

Our project, Kitchen Helper is a household application which tracks household inventory, creates recipes which would indicate how much ingredients will be used, and assigns tasks to household members. The application will be easy to use, with intuitive ways of editing, finding and tracking tasks that have been added. It is optimised for those who prefer working with Command Line Interface (CLI). Kitchen Helper provides convenience in our often busy lives, so give this application a chance to help you!
This user guide aims to help you learn your way around our application, making the learning process smooth and effortless. So what are you waiting for? Letâ€™s go!
