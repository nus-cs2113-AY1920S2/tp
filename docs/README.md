# Duke

HAMS is a CLI-based medical facility administration system that assists in the maintenance of various medical records.
Its functionality has some resemblance to the Duke ChatBot, a CS2113 individual project.

HAMS is designed for administrative assistants in medical facilities, like hospitals or polyclinics, that prefer using CLI to keep track of various medical records and can type fast.
